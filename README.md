# Auto Pack

This was a 3 phase project for "Desigining Human Centered Software" to create a touch screen / tablet user interface for an automated package shipping system.

First we created the lowest of low fidelity wire frames, then papre prototypes, and finally high fidelity wireframes.

I personally prefer actually coding as opposed to keynote... Thus I built a lot of the actual functionality out.

We had 2 days between the paper prototype and the high fidelity wire.
